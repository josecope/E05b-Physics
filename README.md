# E05b-Physics
Hello!

In this assignment, I learned how to apply gravity and other forces through coding.  It was pretty easy to grasp, and it was fun to play with the gravity value and see how big the difference was between the different numbers.

In main1.py, I defined the GRAVITY value as -9.8 and then later applied the value to the acceleration function, plugging in GRAVITY as the y value.

Main2.py was a combination of using the skills gained from main1.py and a few new ones that allowed the balls to bounce around.  First, I copied my steps from the first part of the assignment, defining GRAVITY and then applying it to the acceleration of the balls.  Then, i reversed the velocity of the ball by using the abs function.  This made the balls continually bounce on the bottom of the wall until it ran out of force.

In main3.py, all I did was edit the code to make sure that the animals would bounce of each other.  To do this, I gave the animals temporary velocities and then had them switch velocities when they hit each other, as long as they were the same mass.

Thanks for reading!
